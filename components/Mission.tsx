                <p className="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
                  Every child deserves the ability to communicate. For children with severe disabilities, 
                  expressing basic needs, emotions, or discomfort can be an insurmountable challenge. 
                  This communication barrier doesn't just affect the child, it impacts families, caregivers, 
                  educators, and healthcare providers.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
                  At Neurotech at NC State, we believe that technology can break down these barriers. 
                  Our current focus is on developing specialized Arduino-based switch systems that 
                  children can activate to trigger commands, enabling them to communicate their needs 
                  effectively and independently. 
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  By expanding our outreach and encouraging neuro education in the Triangle, we hope to create a community
                  that is passionate about using technology to make a real difference in the lives of these children and their families.
